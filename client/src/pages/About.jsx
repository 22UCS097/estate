        An estate refers to a large area of land, property, or assets owned by an individual,
         family, or organization. It can include residential, commercial, or agricultural land.
          Estates are often inherited or managed through legal frameworks. In real estate, 
          an estate may refer to different types of ownership, such as freehold or leasehold. 
          Large estates may have multiple buildings, gardens, and facilities. Estate planning involves managing assets for future generations.
           Some estates are historical landmarks or luxury properties. The value of an estate depends on location, size, and market trends.
            Many estates are governed by local property laws and regulations. Proper management ensures the estate remains profitable and well-maintained.
